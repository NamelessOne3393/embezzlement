## Project proposal:

This is an incremental game themed around financial crime. It begins as a edutainment style game about finances, then spirals out into teaching the user how to commit actual crimes. The player starts by buying shares, then buisnesses, then governments. You win the game by buying a very expensive boat.


### What will the application do?

It is a game, all it does is keep track of a number and a bunch of equations that change that number. But its covered in the decor of a finance game. 

The player will recieve money and use it to buy assets that passively earn more money. These assets can vary in how much they return, and sometimes can become insolvent rendering them worthless. 

the player will have access to a limited number of choices at a time for purchasing new assets, but can own an arbitrary number of assets once purchased. 

A portion of the player's income is deducted as taxes, but the player can respond to this by holding their assets in offshore accounts, each of which are a collection of assets. these accounts eventually face taxes of their own, but an arbitrary number may be created at increasing cost. 

Random events may occur temporarily changing aspects of the game, such as a ceo saying something stupid so the companies shares are signifigantly cheaper, or a worker at one of your companies commits embezzlement. 

### Who will use it?

Likely casual gamers and students bored in class, the game will only be published to PC, but will be available in windows and linux. 

### Why is this project of interest to both of you?

Keegan likes making games and Harsh likes finances, a match made in heaven.
