## Team Name:
* Team member 1: Keegan
* Team member 2: Harsh 

## Project proposal:

This is an incremental game themed around financial crime. It begins as a edutainment style game about finances, then spirals out into teaching the user how to commit actual crimes. The player starts by buying shares, then buisnesses, then governments. You win the game by buying a 1,000,000,000,000 dollar boat.


### What will the application do?

It is a game, all it does is keep track of a number and a bunch of equations that change that number. But its covered in the decor of a finance game. It will provide entertainment and mirth. 

### Who will use it?

Likely casual gamers and students bored in class, the game will only be published to PC, but will be available in windows and linux. 

### Why is this project of interest to both of you?

Keegan likes making games and Harsh likes finances, a match made in heaven.
